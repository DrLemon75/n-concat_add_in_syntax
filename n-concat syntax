# neuronal concat programming syntax sets the interaction parameters between the neural networks, on which behavioral predictions are made
# The concat function was extrated from Pandas "pd.concat" but has rather behavioural properties on CNN   
# Syntaxis: n-concat (df:[ X_train : , y_train : , X-test : , y_test : ] (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F)
# (A) A maximum quantity and variance of inter-NN nodes during the sparkle. 
# (B) The mentioned quantity and variance but opened by each layer. 
# (C) The variance not in terms of intermittence by on intellectual-nodes identity. 
# (D) The acceptable random range of the weight in inter-NN edges 
# (E) The NN that are behaviourally concatenated within the basket (assumes levels 
of modularity with non-concatenated NN in the basket). 
# (F) The connectivity definition: decoding the inter-NN weight signal.
